# ReduxExamples

The main purpose of this repo is applying redux-like architecutre in different example projects to get a better sense of redux & swiftUI.

I will also be posting important points on arhcitecture and the things I've learned while following examples, like main principles of redux etc.

Sources & tutorials I've followed can be found down at the bottom.


# Three main redux principles
- Having a single source of truth
- Having read-only App State
- Mutating the state only through Reducer functions.
